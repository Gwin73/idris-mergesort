# idris-mergesort
Verified implementation of a total mergesort in Idris in under 133 loc. The type signature of the mergesort function is ```total mergeSort : (xs : List Nat) -> (ys : List Nat ** (Ordered ys, Permutation xs ys))```, where the definition of the type families ```Ordered``` and ```Permutation``` are borrowed from the standard library of Coq. ```mergeSort``` is only defined on lists of natural numbers, because it seems Idris standard library lacks a type class for decidable orderability (similar to DecEq). The time complexity of the ```mergeSort``` function is probably higher than ```O(n*log(n))``` since the split function used, which is from Idris standard library, has time complexity ```O(n*log(n))```.
